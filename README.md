#  House Price Prediction Model


## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, proximity to key amenities (like colleges, schools and hospitals), and property-specific details (e.g., area, number of rooms, furnishing status). Using statistical and machine learning models, the system analyzes historical housing data to estimate current market prices. An interactive web interface allows users to input property details and receive real-time price predictions. This tool is especially useful for home buyers, real estate agents, and property investors looking to make data-driven decisions.


**Key Features:**

* **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**  Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and preprocessing steps to prepare it for modeling.
* **Model Training:**  Employs various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Parameter tuning was performed for all models, with a focus on Grid Search for optimizing XGBoost.
* **Performance Evaluation:**  Comprehensive evaluation of each model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).

- üìä **Market Analysts**: Study housing market trends and price patterns across different Indian regions

The model's high accuracy (99.9% R¬≤ score with XGBoost) makes it a reliable tool for stakeholders in the Indian real estate market to make informed decisions.

## Methodology

The following steps were undertaken in this project:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and gain insights into the features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Dropping Unnecessary Columns:** Identification and removal of irrelevant or redundant columns.
    * **Ordinal Encoding:** Encoding of ordinal categorical features into numerical representations.
    * **Data Sampling:**  Selection of a subset of approximately 100,000 rows from the dataset due to limited computational resources.
    * **One-Hot Encoding:** Application of One-Hot Encoding using `DictVectorizer` to convert remaining categorical features into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    * Training of the following regression models:
        * Linear Regression
        * Decision Tree
        * Random Forest
        * XGBoost
    * Parameter tuning for each model to optimize performance.
    * Grid Search was specifically used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model.
4. **Performance Evaluation:**  Evaluation of each trained model using the following metrics:
    * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average absolute difference between the predicted and actual prices.
    * **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual prices.
    * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of the MSE, providing an error metric in the original unit of the target variable.
    * **R-squared (R2):**  A statistical measure representing the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## Results

The following performance metrics were achieved by the trained models:

| Model | MAE | MSE | RMSE | R¬≤ Score |
|-------|-----|-----|------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 81.75 | 10364.25 | 101.80 |  0.962|
| Decision Tree | 7.70 | 96.81 | 9.84 | 0.997 |
| Random Forest | 50.60 | 3910.55 | 62.53 | 0.995|
| XGBoost | 6.96 | 78.74 | 8.87 |  0.9997 |

## How to Use the Model

### Prerequisites

- **Pipenv:** For managing Python environments and dependencies.
- **Docker:** For containerized deployment of the model.
- **Flask:** For app/webservice.

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izaanz/ML-Indian-House-Prediction
   navigate to the cloned directory
   ```

2. **Setup Environment:**
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```

3. **Run the Model:**
   
   Note: You may have to run `python train.py` if the model_.bin doesn't validate on your end.
   
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will start a local server where you can send requests to get predictions.

4. **Testing Predictions:**

   You can use predict_test.py to test the predictions.
   
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   This will return a predicted house priced based on the stored data in the file.

## Deployed on Cloud

This is a machine learning-based web application for predicting house prices in India. The app is powered by a regression model that takes various house attributes (such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.) to predict the price of a house.

The app is deployed on the cloud and can be accessed through the following link:
